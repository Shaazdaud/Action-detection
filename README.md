# 📌 Action Detection Project  

## 🎯 Overview  
This project focuses on  **Action Detection** using deep learning techniques. It aims to identify and classify human actions from video sequences, making it useful for applications like **surveillance, sports analytics, and human-computer interaction**.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✔️ **Real-time action detection** using deep learning models  
✔️ **Pre-trained models** (e.g., I3D, SlowFast, or LRCN) for high accuracy  
✔️ **Support for multiple datasets**, including UCF101, Kinetics, and custom datasets  
✔️ **Frame extraction & preprocessing** for optimized training  
✔️ **Visualization** of detected actions with bounding boxes
